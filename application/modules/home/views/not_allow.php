    <h1>What Happens When You Sign Up?</h1>
    <p>
        Chill out! It's all free and it's no big deal.<br>
        Signing up takes about one minute. You enter a few details (username, password, email address) and that's it!<br>
        So, just to be clear.<br>
    <ul>
        <li> It's all free</li>
        <li>You don't have to dish out any heavy information</li>
        <li>If you're not happy then you can un-join at any time</li>
        <li>Your details will NOT be passed onto anybody else</li>
        <li>You won't get spammed</li>
        <li>Nothing uncool will happen</li>
        <li>Thousands of people have joined and nobody has every complained about anything uncool happening</li>
        <li>Oh, and the whole vibe is handled by Mailchimp. So, you definitely do NOT have to worry about anything uncool happening.</li>

    </ul>
       

So, stay cool and don't go paranoid on me. It's a good vibe. Nothing uncool will happen to you. You have my word. - Kinny
